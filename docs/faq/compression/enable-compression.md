# Can I enable compression at any time ?

You can't change this parameter at any time. We don't store any state to determine whether the files you stored were compressed or not.

This means that if you enable this parameter after taking your first snapshots, some files will be compressed and others will not. This inconsistency can cause issues when restoring your data. **YOU DON'T WANT THAT!**
