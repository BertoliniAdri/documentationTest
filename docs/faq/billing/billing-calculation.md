# What is the process for calculating billing charges ?

We are billing two different objects at Datashelter:
- **Servers:** calculated based on the number of servers configured in your account at the end of the month.
- **Storage:** calculated based on the maximum terabytes (TB) of storage utilized during the month.

This means that **you can freely add and remove servers for testing purpose without any impact on your billing**. You will only be billed for the servers that were active at the end of the month.
