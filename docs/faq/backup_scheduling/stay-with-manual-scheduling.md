# Can I continue using manual scheduling for my backups?

Youâ€™re free to choose not to let snaper manage itâ€™s own crontabs. Your server, your choices ðŸ˜„

Just keep in mind that we wonâ€™t be able to send your alerts in case we donâ€™t receive your backups anymore. To know more about that, feel free to contact our support team at [support@datashelter.tech](mailto:support@datashelter.tech)
