# How do we encrypt your data?

Encryption of your data is essential for maintaining confidentiality and security. That's why Snaper encrypts your data **on your server** using **your own encryption key** before sending it to our cloud.

Specifically, we derive a 256-bit AES key, which will be used to encrypt all your files. AES 256 is currently one of the most robust encryption technologies available.

This approach ensures a high level of security and protection for your data.
