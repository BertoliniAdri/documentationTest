# Do you encrypt data at rest in S3 ?

Data encryption is essential for privacy and security. We strongly recommend encrypting your data with a personal key.

With this in mind, Snaper encrypts your data before sending it to the S3 compatible DataShelter's cloud, ensuring only you have access.

Specifically, we generate a robust 32-bit AES 256 key before transferring your files. This key, known for its powerful encryption abilities, is used to encrypt your files.

This approach **guarantees a high level of security** and protection for **your data**.
